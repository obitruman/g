    <h1>The Garrett John Fookes Experience: A Cautionary Tale</h1>
<a href="https://ibb.co.com/Wxn43s4"><img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/Wxn43s4/1643041357079.jpg" alt="1643041357079" border="0"></a>
    <p>Welcome to this website. I've created this platform to share my personal experience with Garrett John Fookes, focusing on a particular investment venture. My intention is to inform and alert others who may be considering similar engagements with him.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Several years ago, I was presented with an opportunity to invest in a project led by Garrett John Fookes. The project was pitched with enthusiasm and promised significant returns upon realization. Motivated by the potential and Garrett's assurances, I decided to invest.</p>

    <h2>The Unfolding</h2>
    <p>As time progressed, it became apparent that the project milestones were not being met. The updates from Garrett began to dwindle, and the promised progress was nowhere in sight. Despite repeated inquiries and discussions about the direction of the project, the responses I received were often vague or overly optimistic without substantial evidence of progress.</p>

    <h2>Financial Outcomes</h2>
    <p>It was later revealed that the funds invested in the project had been depleted without achieving any of the outlined goals. Attempts to understand the allocation of these funds were met with evasive answers, and it became clear that the initial promises were not going to be fulfilled.</p>

    <h2>Promises of Reimbursement</h2>
    <p>Garrett John Fookes acknowledged the failure to meet the project's objectives and made several commitments to reimburse the invested funds. These assurances were repeated over several years, yet no repayment was ever initiated. Communication gradually decreased and eventually ceased, leaving investors, including myself, in a challenging position.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of This Site</h2>
    <p>The purpose of sharing this experience is not to defame or seek retribution against Garrett John Fookes but to provide a factual account of my dealings with him regarding this investment. My hope is to offer insight to others who might find themselves in a similar situation or considering an engagement with Garrett.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Investment, by its nature, carries risk. However, transparency, integrity, and communication are fundamental to managing that risk. The experience described here underscores the importance of diligence and caution in investment decisions.</p>

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p>Garrett John Fookes has held various positions over the years, culminating in his role as Senior Sales Executive at Supermetrics. His career has spanned different functions and industries, including a significant tenure at Apple and an entrepreneurial endeavor as Co-Founder of PitchMe Inc. His career path is documented across several platforms:</p>

    <h2>The PitchMe Inc. Proposition</h2>
    <p>The startup at the center of my investment experience with Garrett John Fookes was PitchMe Inc, based in Tampere, Finland. It was promoted as an innovative platform poised to disrupt how companies manage ideas and feedback internally.</p>

    <h3>Discrepancies and Misrepresentations</h3>
    <p>It has come to my attention that there are discrepancies between what was pitched and the information available online. A website claims that PitchMe Inc hit $168.1K in revenue with a 6 person team in 2021, which conflicts with the reality I experienced as an investor. This is a prime example of why it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence before engaging in any investment.</p>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>Based on my experience, I strongly advise against engaging in any form of collaboration or interaction with Garrett John Fookes, as it may pose a risk of fraud. My intent in sharing this information is to caution others and prevent similar situations from occurring. Please consider this warning seriously in your decision-making.</p>

    <h2>A Note on Potential Scam</h2>
    <p>The term "scam" is strong and should be used with caution. In light of the events and outcomes shared on this site, I feel it's important to express concerns that interactions with Garrett John Fookes may bear characteristics of a scam. This is based on the combination of unfulfilled promises, lack of transparency in financial dealings, and the ultimate disappearance after commitments of reimbursement were made. While I cannot legally define these actions as a scam without a court's judgment, I advise due diligence and extreme caution if you consider any dealings with him. My goal is to share my experience to help others make informed decisions and possibly avoid similar unfortunate situations.</p>
